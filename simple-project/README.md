This project identifies an inset map on a pamphlet and gives it the text "MAP CONTENT".  You can load the [manifest.json](https://static.t-pen.org/simple-project/manifest.json) link in your preferred IIIF viewer.  It is assumed that the Annotations sent in are processed and preserved so they can be presented on the way out.
